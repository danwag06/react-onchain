# Contributing to React OnChain

Thank you for your interest in contributing to React OnChain! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions. We're building something cool together!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (required for native fetch support)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/react-onchain.git
   cd react-onchain
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Make your changes in the `src/` directory
3. Format your code (required before committing):
   ```bash
   npm run format
   ```
4. Build and verify your changes compile:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. Test your changes locally:
   ```bash
   # Test with dry-run mode
   node dist/cli.js deploy --build-dir ./test-app/dist --dry-run
   ```

### Code Formatting

This project uses **Prettier** for consistent code formatting across all contributors.

#### Before Committing

Always format your code before committing:

```bash
npm run format
```

#### Check Formatting

To verify code is properly formatted without changing files:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

#### Editor Integration

**VS Code** users: Format-on-save is automatically configured in `.vscode/settings.json`. Just save your files and Prettier will format them.

**Other Editors**: Install the Prettier plugin for your editor and enable format-on-save.

### Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, meaningful names for variables and functions
- **Functions**: Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public APIs and complex logic
- **Imports**: Use ES6 imports with `.js` extensions for local files
- **Error Handling**: Use try-catch blocks and provide meaningful error messages
- **Async/Await**: Prefer async/await over promise chains

   npm run build
   ```
3. Commit your changes with a clear, descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add exponential retry for UTXO errors"
   ```
4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request on GitHub

### Commit Message Format

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

- `feat: add new feature`
- `fix: resolve bug in inscriber`
- `docs: update README`
- `refactor: simplify retry logic`
- `test: add tests for analyzer`
